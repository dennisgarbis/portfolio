                        <p>I made a logo for my Photoshop class for a Greek island touring company. It was called
                            Cyclade's Tour. I took that logo and replaced the name with what you see here.</p>
                        <p>The wireframe
                            was a really rough sketch of what I though the menu would look like. The header and footer
                            came out to looking something like what I had originally drawn, but the main content did
                            not. I did use three columns, but they were separated with rows. I also never included an
                            image toward the bottom that I had intended on. The rest of the site I did off the top of my
                            head.</p>

                            I
                            changed the layout often while I was coding it out. I also created a small movie using <a

                            had a real fun time with After Effects and wanted to continue using it in more in my
                            projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>I included a carousel and testimonials on the homepage and a contact form on the contact
                            page. This was my first time using Bootstrap and I found it very easy for everything to be
                            responsive.</p>

                        <p>The most difficult part of the entire website was creating the image below. It is found on
                            the About Us page and for some reason it was giving me difficulties. After a bit of erasing
                            code and trying again, I got it to work.</p>

                <h2>The Finished Product</h2>
                <p>The project took me about a month to finish. I spent most of my time adjusting the table showing the
                    hours of operation, as well as the carousel with the food. The biggest sticking point there was how
                    to have the title of the food show on the screen. I learned a lot using Bootstrap. Once I got the
                    hang of how the code is written out, it was pretty straightforward. Though I enjoy using flexbox,
                    and understand it pretty well, Bootstrap will be something I will be using in the future again.</p>
