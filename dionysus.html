                <p>I'm Greek. I like Greek food. So what else would I do but make a Greek Restaurant and name it after a
                    Greek God from whom my name originates.</p>

                        <h2>Bootstrap 5</h2>
                        <p>This project was to create a responsive website. I decided to use Bootstrap as my CSS
                            framework, using ideas from <a href="https://www.getbootstrap.com"
                                target="_blank">getbootstrap.com</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"
                                target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to build a Greek restaurant. It was my first time using a
                            framework, and I found it not as challenging as I thought it would be.</p>
                        <p>Using bootstrap classes was an easy way to make the site responsive. There are many
                            components to choose from, and these were the ones I ended up using on my site: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>navbar</li>
                            <li>carousel</li>
                            <li>contact form</li>
                            <li>list group</li>

                        <p>I made a logo for my Photoshop class for a Greek island touring company. It was called
                            Cyclade's Tour. I took that logo and replaced the name with what you see here.</p>
                        <p>The wireframe was a rough sketch of what I envisioned the menu page becoming. The
                            header and footer area ended up how I had it sketched, but the main content did
                            not. I did use three columns separated with rows, though. I also never included an
                            image toward the bottom that I had intended. The rest of the site I did off the top of my
                            head.</p>

                        <p>The rest of the site I did off the top of my head. I had ideas as to what will go where, but
                            I changed the layout often while I was coding it out. I also created a small movie using <a
                                href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html" target="_blank">After
                                Effects.</a> I had a fun time with After Effects and wanted to continue using it in more
                            of my
                            projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>I included a carousel and testimonials on the homepage and a contact form on the contact
                            page. It was my first time using Bootstrap, and I found it very easy for everything to be
                            responsive.</p>

                            Have I mentioned how easy it was to set everything up with Bootstrap?</p>
                        <p>I had some difficulties with the website. One was creating this section found on the About Us
                            page. It took me a while to get the images sized up and placed where I wanted them, but as
                            soon as I figured it out, I realized what I was doing wrong and even recreated it in another
                            project to make sure I was doing it correctly.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="finished">
                <h2>The Finished Product</h2>
                <p>The project took me about a month to finish, working on it several hours a week. I spent the most
                    time adjusting the table showing the hours of operation, the carousel with the food, and the about
                    us section. The sticking point with the carousel was how
                    to have the title of the image displayed on the screen. I learned a lot using Bootstrap. Once I got
                    the hang of how the code works, it was straightforward. Though I enjoy using flexbox and do
                    understand it well, Bootstrap will be something I will be using in the future again.</p>
